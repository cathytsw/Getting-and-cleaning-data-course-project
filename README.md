# Getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project
This repo is created for finishing the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Course.
* Data files were downloaded from this link [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip] and unzipped.
* The unzipped and needed data files were loaded into the R working directory.
* The R script "run_analysis.R" was executed to get the tidy data which was exported into "tidydata.txt".

### Descirption of the original data
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
